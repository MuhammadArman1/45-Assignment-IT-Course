// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

type car = {
    manufacturer: string,
    model: string,
    [key: string]: any
}
function manufacturer(Manufacturer:string, Model:string, more:Partial<car>){
    return {
        manufacturer: Manufacturer,
        model: Model,
        ...more
    }
}
console.log(manufacturer("Toyota", "Corolla", {Color: "Gray", Year: 2024}));
