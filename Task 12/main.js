// Task 12
// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
let person = ["Arman", "Alhan", 'Samad'];
for (let i = 0; i < person.length; i++) {
    console.log(`How are you, ${person[i]}!`);
